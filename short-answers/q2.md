# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
Pass by value - copy of value passed to the function 
Pass by reference - referenc to original value 

pass by reference is mutable because it changes the perameter in a function  

# Teacher Feedback

You are correct that pass by reference is mutable but not because it changes the parameter but because the values referenced get changed permanently when you use the function!
